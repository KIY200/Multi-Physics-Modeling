Slide Title:
  Equivalent-Circuit Power Flow Results (Regular Wave: H = 2 m, T = 8.94 s)

Talk Track (60–90 seconds):
  • This slide summarizes power flow metrics for WEC1 and WEC2 using the equivalent-circuit transmission model.
  • We report both RMS-based and energy-based metrics; energy-based efficiency is typically more robust for non-sinusoidal or irregular signals.

  WEC1:
    - Delivered efficiency (energy-based) = 44.1%; RMS-based = 29.4%.
    - Transmission loss fraction (energy-based) = 0.1%; RMS-based = 0.1%.
    - RMS powers [kW]: Pin=2222.05, PTO=653.70, Loss=0.57, Delivered=653.16.
    - Tracking: Corr(Pin,PTO)=0.44, lag=3.610 s.

  WEC2:
    - Delivered efficiency (energy-based) = 45.3%; RMS-based = 29.6%.
    - Transmission loss fraction (energy-based) = 0.1%; RMS-based = 0.1%.
    - RMS powers [kW]: Pin=1665.46, PTO=493.24, Loss=0.32, Delivered=492.94.
    - Tracking: Corr(Pin,PTO)=0.44, lag=3.631 s.

Key Takeaways (bullet options for the slide):
  • Delivered efficiency: WEC1 44.1% vs WEC2 45.3% (energy-based).
  • Loss fraction: WEC1 0.1% vs WEC2 0.1% (energy-based).
  • PTO power tracks wave input with Corr 0.44/0.44 and lag 3.610/3.631 s (WEC1/WEC2).

Suggested Next Step:
  • Confirm sensitivity to cable parameters (R, L, C) and extend the same analysis to irregular seas / varying PTO control settings.
